Machine Learning-Based Rainfall Prediction & Alert System for Farmers
A complete ML + Web Application that predicts rainfall using the CatBoost algorithm and sends automated email alerts to farmers based on their location. Built with Python, Flask, MySQL, and trained on structured meteorological data.


OVERVIEW
Unpredictable rainfall leads to crop loss, improper irrigation planning, and reduced yield.
This project provides farmers with accurate, location-based rainfall predictions and real-time alerts, empowering them to take preventive actions.

The system integrates:
✔ A trained CatBoost ML model
✔ A Flask web application
✔ Farmer registration module
✔ Automated email alert system
✔ User-friendly prediction interface
